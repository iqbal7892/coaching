                                        <p>A good coach can earn $200 or more per session; however, you will probably need to gain experience and a clientele to earn that kind of money. But here’s something to think about: say you get only $70 per session as a novice coach, and you have only 10 trainees per month, and each one of them comes in for only four sessions per month. The math is simple:  you will be able to earn $2,800 a month, and you invested just 40 hours of work per month, in your spare time! That’s an amazing figure and that’s just an initial number. A veteran coach can easily earn a five figure amount per month, from only a few trainees. </p>

                                        <p>We believe that anyone can be coach assuming he has accumulated experience in life. After all, a small merchant who has never studied yet manages his store successfully is an expert in the art of bargaining and business management. A teacher who has taught children for 30 years – is an expert in discipline and training, if you cooked for your family all your life,  if you were that mother who listens, comforts and is friends with your children –  you probably have more experience containing people and making them happy than most professionals. We will help you transform your experience into knowledge that builds people into success. </p>
