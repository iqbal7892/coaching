                            The primary goal of a life coach is to work in partnership with clients to identify and clarify their vision and goals for the future, and then to help them work out the practical steps to achieve them. These steps may include identifying gaps in skills and knowledge or identifying self-limiting beliefs and other challenges or obstacles they face and then working out a plan of action to address them. </p>
                        <p class="feature-text-para">
                            All the steps are designed to help clients with self-discovery and growth and to equip them to take accountability for their own lives. The coach provides experience, objective perspective and insight together with support to help clients achieve their maximum potential.

                            We can perhaps better understand who needs a coach if we look at top athletes: they use coaches because they want to improve their performance.  The same reason applies to business leaders and small business owners, executives and entrepreneurs, professionals and homemakers, new graduates and retirees. Some people are just starting out and others have been around for some time but have hit a plateau or a barrier of some sort. Whoever they are, if they believe they could do better in either their professional or their personal lives, then a life coach might be for them.

                        Have you ever seen friends and family members struggling to achieve something and wished that you could just share your own experience and knowledge with them? Have you been successful at something and as a result others keep asking you for advice? Have you become an expert in your field and want to help others who are starting out? Would you like to convert your experience into a new way of earning an income? If so, perhaps you should consider becoming a life coach.

                        At Coaching Masters, we believe that anyone can become a coach, provided you have sufficient life experience. This experience may come from academic learning, self-learning or unique life events. This doesn’t mean you have to be old – many young people have incredible knowledge and experience to share with others. What you need is the training to combine your expertise with skilled delivery.

A good coach can earn $200 or more per session; however, you will probably need to gain experience and a clientele to earn that kind of money. But here’s something to think about: say you get only $70 per session as a novice coach, and you have only 10 trainees per month, and each one of them comes in for only four sessions per month. The math is simple:  you will be able to earn $2,800 a month, and you invested just 40 hours of work, and this could be in your spare time! That’s an amazing figure and that’s just an initial number. A veteran coach can easily earn a five-figure amount per month, from only a few trainees</p>
